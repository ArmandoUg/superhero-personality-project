 This file is a read me file that details the workings of this marvel character personality quiz app. This app was built using java script, css, html, css bootstrap and a server api from Marvel.  The main page contains a start button and two carousels that rotate marvel character images. The user will want to navigate the page and operate the start button.

A quiz will then populate the lower half of the page with the help of java script.  The user will the operate the quiz to determine which of the marvel characters added will the user be matched too.

Once the user answers the last question, the user will be redirected to another html page that is built with html and css. The end page also has java script to use the marvel api to fetch data and is appended dynamically with js as well.
